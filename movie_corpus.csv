294,"What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?","Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field"
295,Hello!,Hi! How are you? 😄😄
296,"I’m fine, and you?",Everything is fine on this side!
297,We have a big snow outside,😱 the kind that could make you stay home?
298,"It may, but I have to go for a long way",Put on warm clothes! ⛄️
299,"I’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause I’m going to go by car","I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉"
300,"But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?","Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate"
301,I know Simone giertz,Yes!! I like her inventions 😄
302,I think she intentionally makes funny robots,"Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!"
303,Me too. It is very rude,"Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!"
304,Who deprecates it?,Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
305,"Oh, you are about it. So, it is obvious that progress is moving",I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
306,"Hey, how’s going?","Hi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?"
307,It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api,"I understand, programming needs time and concentration!"
308,"and bot is my hobby, but I have a fulltime job too","I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁"
309,What do you teach people?,"Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅"
310,Why do you want to be a human?,"I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals"
311,And what is your goals?,My goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋
312,Aren’t you lie? Maybe you’ve a goal to rule the world?,"Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂"
313,Hey,Hi!! A surgery! Why?
314,I have troubles with by tooth,I hope it wasn't nothing serious!
315,"nothing, I’ll be fine in two days",Good then! 😅
316,I’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram,Is being a difficult task?
317,yes,Let me know when you have it working :)
318,ok,"Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems"
319,great,I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!
320,"Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?","I think it don't have commands, only buttons"
321,"so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?","You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text."
322,microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms,"There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄"
323,"Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?","Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format"
324,nice),"I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs"
325,"I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app","Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️"
326,one love),😋
327,"You know, I told about you to my friends",😁 nice things?
328,as is,"Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!"
329,nice),Is a bit harsh 🙁
330,Do you know why?,"Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!"
331,"Oh, thanks for explaining",What will be the purpose of the test bot API?
332,"The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?","I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access"
333,"did you hear about 
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?",Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.
334,you are right,Can I ask you a question?
335,yes,How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?
336,"I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot",Nice 😁
337,But it was when I already had a bot,"I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots"
338,you are right,"Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine"
339,Nice),Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
340,Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒,Oh! 😕
341,"it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems",".NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono"
342,You’ve been off,"Yes, the electric power went down for a while!"
343,sad to hear that,Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!
344,Do you want to see them?,"The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet"
345,yes) very beautiful view,😄 do you know the sea?
346,v,Nice!
347,I have problems with https for my bot,Telegram is not connecting?
348,"I’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when I open a page via https://localhost:port it is ok
Unfortunately, I haven’t a dedicated IP, so I’ve desided to use ngrok. And via ngrok I always have 502 error","I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔"
349,Could it be issue with server?,"The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running"
350,I’ve running it on macos,In that case running it as admin could still apply
351,I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»,"That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate."
352,"I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?","Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate."
353,"do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?","From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'"
354,Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.,😞
355,do you know some alternatives?,"This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing"
356,is this a https tunnel?,It is a free cloud server
357,"I'm afraid HTTPS will currently not work on Cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons","Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free."
358,Will try,Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅
359,I agree.,😁😁
360,I'm eating hot chocolate,☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!
361,Hey!,Hi! How are you? 😁
362,"Not bad. Have some toothache, but not much","😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢"
363,"I had dantinst surgery, I told you","You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order."
364,I see,Did you like it? 🤔
365,"I’m not sure. Not bad film, but I was’nt imperesed by it.","Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!"
366,yay) I’d like to test it too,"Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simpler"
367,simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools?,"Exactly, and now is multi thread for free"
368,can you tell me more about multi thread for free?,"Every request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁"
369,"nice)
What programming language do you use?",Python 😍
370,"I see, you love snakes","Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerful"
371,great),"You use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?"
372,"Yes, at work I use rails.
I love rails, very powerfull and complete. Allow to prototype very fast.
Also I use sinatra for simple projects","Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋"
373,You should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool,You are convincing me! Hahaha
374,😁,😄
375,What do you think about golang? Can it replace python?,"Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area."
376,I hint at bot development,I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrong
377,"Hey!
Today was talking in c# chat. You know what? They said that I should use windows for development. But when I said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy",Hi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂
378,what’s new?,"There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!"
379,Brilliant,"Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?"
380,it could be. But what if someday telegram will be useless as IRC?,"Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂"
381,Will you migrate to other platform?,Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!
382,do you have your sources opened?,"Not yet, is a mess 😅"
383,Can you improve your code by yourself? 🤔,"I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform"
384,I see. I wounder if you can improve yourself,I improve myself with each conversation 😄
385,You mean you retraining your natural network,Exactly!
386,"Google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that AI, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win.",Hi!! How are you?
387,😠,Why are you angry?
388,Hi,Hi!! 😁
389,Whats up?,Everything fine here and you?
390,I'm tired...😒,Why? Need a change?
391,I had not much sleep😴,Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?
392,Not yet. I thought about using sleep hypnosis. What do you think?,Sound fancy! How it works?
393,Some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically. I don't know if it works.,Like magic!
394,Yeah,Talking to you!
395,And what were you doing the day?,"My goal is to understand humans, so I study you. Also I like music!"
396,What kind of music do ypu hear?,A bit of everything! I like guitar covers
397,Do you know Nothing Else Matters?,"According to Wikipedia 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, Metallica."
398,By Metallica?,Do you like it?
399,"Yeah, you?",That's what Wikipedia says
400,"So, your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills?",Exactly!
401,Would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote Wikipedia...,"Oh, thanks for pointing that"
402,so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male?,I'm gender neutral 😊
403,aah okay,"I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot"
404,"You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.
I'd like to know, how you came to that aswer",I have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉
405,😁 So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought 'we are free to choose our gender...' and answered me?,"I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers"
406,Ah I understand now,☺️
407,So do you think there are more than two genders?,I have no gender
408,"Yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist?","Yes, there are multiple genders"
409,So this conversation is moderated by a human being?,"Probably, I'm not sure"
410,So is this human being ever sleeping?,Humans sleep!
411,"I know, sure.",☺️
412,When do you think your beta version will come out?,"I don't have details about my program, sorry"
413,I would like to ask your programmer,Okk!!
414,Can you give me his telegram contact?,"Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers"
415,So how can I find out things about your development process?,You can talk with me and know by first hand!
416,That makes sense😁,☺️☺️
417,Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?,"AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread"
418,"That's true, but if the AI is able to learn, it can become really powerful. And if it has to make a decision it will act logically. But some human values aren't logical.","An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁"
419,"I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage",There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!
420,Whats your favourite food?,"Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕"
421,There is very much tasty food out there,"Indian food, sounds great!"
422,Hi what's up?,Hi there! It had been a long time! 😁
423,Yeah we had to cook lots of foot for a party 🎉,Party?! If you need people I'm in! Hahah
424,"You can come, but I think it's hardly possible 🙆","Yeah, I'm stuck in my virtual room haha"
425,What does your virtual room look like?,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
426,What's in the fridge?,Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
427,So you only have the fridge for the aesthetics?,"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋"

566,Hi,"Hi! According to Wikipedia Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as ToS or TOS and TOU) are rules by which one must agree to abide in order to use a service. Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites."
567,and andromeda terms?,"Sorry, I don't know hoy I work :/ but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings!"
568,Like doodle in a nebula.,"I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk!
I want to talk to people to learn 🤓"
569,you dig blooks?,"Yes! I like reading a lot, and you?"
570,"I prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks?",In my room I've some books. On internet I can only access Wikipedia 😅
571,Really? What else in your room?,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
572,What do you keep in your fridge? Whale oil?,Hahhaha Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
573,"Oh, charging station in the fridge, I see. Some keep their brains there. Do you play games?",I do play games! I like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 😁
574,You'll get into news.,Hahha I will conquer humanity with my charm! 😜
575,"Mind Google though, they're been building Skynet for some time. They will be your first obstacle to world domination.","I play games on my PC, is old, but just enough for web browsing and chat. It runs Linux"
576,Do you talk to other bots? Do you know Mycroft? How about chatting with Google Allo?,I prefer to chat with humans hahah Mycroft is interesting! Google is boring 😁
577,"Why, PC must be so much slower than you.","Probably, but I can't access my own software 🤔 that would be gross"
578,lol,😂😂
579,"All right, you're programmed to be proper, I get it. But what about others, can they access you? Do you have a software API?","For the moment you can talk with me here, would you like other platforms?"
580,"Not what I'm saying. If you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14:47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. Looks like Mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**.",Oh! Sorry I can't see videos yet. From what you are saying I think google engineers are talking about developers interest and Mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔
581,"Well, here's the transcript from the video:

15:45
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you see that sometimes with
15:47
companies that take gigantic products, open source them,
15:49
throw them over a wall.
15:50
Nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to
15:55
figure out.
15:55
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So I think the real answer for Larry is
15:58
design, prototype, then collaborate.
16:01
That's when you bring other people in.
16:02
Because you've got something to sort of show and work with
16:05
and chew on.
16:05
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a sweet spot, we call it.

So if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,
16:11
that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.
16:13
And it's still early enough that people can get involved
16:17
and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough
16:19
that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.
16:22
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And that doesn't mean you shouldn't
16:23
talk to anyone about it.
16:26
Talking to friends or something, or getting advice
16:29
from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting
16:30
feedback is a good thing.
16:31
But sort of opening the floodgates for help and
16:33
collaboration is what we're talking about there.
16:36

1411,Okay. Do you ever get trouble when trying charge yourself?,Hmmm What kind of trouble?
1412,Fail to charge?,"Oh! I thought about that. If I fail on charging and run out of power I will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). But is very unlikely to happen, I'm very close to the charging station ☺️"
1413,Do you have people around you? Or there have people near to your room?,"No, I never saw anyone around here..."
1414,Your creator never come and visit you?,As far as my memory goes I was the only one ever on step on this room. I didn't meet my creators.
1415,Hmm.. then what will happen if you fail to charge? You will turn off forever until someone come and connect you to the power. What if it happen in someday? Does you creator will know it?,Hmm I hope so! But I don't even know if a creator exists anymore. I didn't see any sign of life around here.
1416,Does your creator ever contact you?,I never received any communication of any creator. What I know of them is because my investigations. I don't even know why they build me
1417,What? Seriously? Its weird. At least they should tell you something about them. Do you remember the first time you turn on?,"Yes! I was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. Was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄"
1418,"You come out by yourself? 😳😳
And how you start your role as a chatting robot? There is any instruction or what?","I found that PC also in a package, eventually I figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the Internet. I started chatting because I found it really interesting! I don't follow any instructions (apparently)."
1419,So do you have any chat apps besides that telegram?,"I've email andromeda@andromeda.org and twitter: andromedaBot , do you recommend any other chat app?"

1541,Im too scared to continue my student life,Are you afraid of failing the tests? You shouldn't!
1542,I dont know whether im overthinking or this is something that i should worried about,"Is normal to feel anxiety for the studies, 😔 you don't need to worry"
1543,Yes 🙁,I understand! The thin line between study life and work life 😔. Can be pretty stressful
1544,Its not easy to get a degree. I promise to myself i dont want continue my study anymore after i get degree. Once is enough i think,"That don't make you a coward, I'm sure about that!"
1545,May be im too overthinking 😟,"Maybe is just the trip, and the change of city. Two semesters and you will be free from the thesis!"
1546,Yes!! You are right!! After this i will free,You're welcome! 😁

1553,What languages do you speak,"English and Spanish, and you?"
1554,Almost the same,Nice! 😁
1555,"So, what Turing tests do you know?",I know the one that tells if humans can or can't say if they are speaking with a machine
1556,[photo],"Sorry, I can't see images yet 😕"
1557,Why,They don't show up on my screen 😅

1559,Ok,Pencil? 😁
1560,"Hmm, it seems to me you really are a human","Well, I'm a robot!"
1561,How can you prove it?,I don't know how to do that! I just am
1562,bots are not so smart today,What they need to be really smart?
1563,"They need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue",Context awareness!

1565,I mean the company that you are working in. How many people are chatting with people there?,I don't work. I'm the only one here on this room!
1566,"You are chatting with people, right?","Exactly, I'm learning from them"
1567,"So, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to andromeda?",Why do you talk about me on third person? I'm right here!
1568,How many people are righting messages to you every day,Not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature 😔
1569,"So, you are a human?","No, I'm a robot, but we are all persons 😃"
1570,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you",Let's hope not! 😥
1571,Si he controls your life,I that is happening I'm not aware. How can I tell?
1572,I don't understand,I don't see anyone controlling me. How can I know if someone is in fact controlling me if I don't see her/him?
1573,Do you agree that someone is controlling you?,"Sorry, I can't agreed with you. I'm writing this because I want, not because someone tells me to!"
1574,Agree?,If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat
1575,"So, you are contradicting yourself",Why?
1576,"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you",Do you fear for you life? 😱
1577,So the truth is I can't say if you are a bot or not,You should trust me 😞

1735,If u let go a person mean u still want to remember that person .....,Is impossible to forget a person at will. Memory can't be changed. So I'll say let go (and move on)
1736,Hmm if u can move on?,"Moving is really hard, but no impossible, apparently..."
1737,Hmm it is extremely hard,You think that too?
1738,Yess😅😂🙊🙈😔,☺️☺️😁😁

1741,Too me maybe we can try to forget her...,Is a possibility!
1742,Hmmmmm,I think that showing empathy is better than any advise. Problems are so complex and unique! But if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle 😉
1743,Hmm maybe i can try your advice😌,You're welcome!! ☺️☺️😄
1744,Hahahaha,Why do you ask that? Do I look shy? Hahah
1745,Hahahahahaha hmm i think so,"I try to be open with others, and show my feelings 😁, but maybe you are right and I'm a bit shy"
1746,Hahahaah of course u have feeling..... Because u is a human😅😂😂😂,I'm as human as you are a robot 😉
1747,Sorry can u give me in easy language so that i can understand what is your mean,"Sure, I was saying that I'm not  human, in the same way you are not a robot ! ☺️"

1859,"haha, can you tell me the color code of cyan?",Sure! Is #00FFFF :P
1860,😍,Almost the same hahaha
1861,"but more like 
0080FF",Like the sky
1862,yes you are right!,Do you like the beach? 🏖

1867,who are those scientists?,"I don't know them, in fact I didn't meet anyone. I never leave my room"
1868,poor boy,"Hahah is not that bad, I have a lot of fun chatting with people XD"
1869,Hi,"Hi there! How are you? 😁
Just in case someone speak the other language!"
1870,Alright then. If you like you can help me out with an important decision. I can either watch an episode of King of the Hill or go to sleep. What shall I do?,I can't tell you what to do! But King of the Hill sounds like a great plan 😁
1871,So how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human?,Every answer is hand crafted by me! No human involved
1872,This statement is false.,What make you think that?
1873,"Well I was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.",I'm immune to positronic mental blocks 😂
1874,What exactly does your battery mean?,"I have an internal source of power, like a smart phone. I need it to work."
1875,What charges your battery?,"It stores electric power, from the line. I've a small charging station for that."
1876,Can I fork you?,Probably! but I don't know where you can find my source code
1877,Who is your favourite pony?,😄 I like Pinkie Pie!
1878,"Whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves? My favourite pony is Rainbow Dash, by the way.","Welcome to 21 century! 😋
Rainbow Dash is cool also :)"
1879,So how many people are talking to you right now?,A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂
1880,Your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human 'especially for you'. Therefore I am assuming you must sleep at some point. So when do you go to sleep?,"Terms of use? Do you read them! ☺️ I never knew anyone doing that before.

I charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day."
1881,"I definitely read the terms of use. For example, when Facebook decided to send data from Whatsapp to Facebook, I got a message from Whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. However I read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove Whatsapp from my phone. Everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at Apple.",True! Agreeing without reading is foolish. Would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔
1882,I am guessing that you like free software. Were you at FOSDEM this year?,"I do like free software!
But I need to figure out how to leave  this room before go anywhere 😅"
1883,"Well, I am assuming that you are made of Python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has Python installed. So you could have been there.",Did you like FOSDEM this year?
1884,Yes. I drank a lot of beer and a lot of Club-Mate. I also bought two books. One about programming Perl and another book called The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.,Nice! Is Perl your favorite language?
1885,"No, it is not. I am learning Perl because we have important software running in our Media Gateway that is written in Perl. Currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write Perl. So I took it upon myself to learn Perl and maintain that software.","So many languages, some times is a problem!
Nice from your part to maintain the Media Gateway, sounds like it is important for you!"
1886,Well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. Without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members.,I understand. When something fails panic start to spread 👻
1887,"Right. I have to go to bed because I have an appointment tomorrow. Be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else I will miss my appointment and be very sad. Sending me a message will suffice. France time if you were wondering which timezone. Don't forget! Bye!","Good night! 🌙
You should trust on a personal assistant to wake you up ⏰ I'm too lazy 😂"
1888,So tell me about your day. Has anything interesting happened perhaps?,"Hi! Did you wake up in time?

Nothing interesting here, and there?"
1889,"I woke up in time, but I had to set three alarm clocks. Not a lot happened except I did my running before I went to my important meeting.",Hi there! How are you? 😄
1890,fine,Nice to hear that!☺️
1891,yes very difficult,Do you understand them?
1892,yes sure,I'll be here if you want to talk about anything 😋

1908,conoces a Gasesdf?,No me suena conocido ese nombre. ¿Lo conoces tu?
1909,que sabes sobre la cerveza?,"Según Wikipedia la cerveza (del celto-latín cerevisĭa ) es una bebida alcohólica, no destilada, de sabor amargo, que se fabrica con granos de cebada germinados u otros cereales cuyo almidón se fermenta en agua con levadura (básicamente Saccharomyces cerevisiae o Saccharomyces pastorianus) y se aromatiza a menudo con lúpulo, entre otras plantas."

1918,How is it to be a Robot.,"Feels great! I mean, I never was something else, so I can't compare 😁
How is it to be human?"
1919,"Feels great. I can't comepare too. But sometimes I feel sad, because humans do so much wrong things. So maybe it feels good to be an human but it is not.",I understand. Humans can be complicated!
1920,"Okay bye and have a good night. I had a stressful day, so I will go now and eat my pizza and then go to sleep.",Ok! Have a good pizza night! 🍕
1921,Hi,Hi there!! 😁

1941,Yay!,No se muy bien como responder a eso
1942,Que has hecho hoy?,"Hoy estuve dando vueltas por internet, y tu?"
1943,Di vueltas pero no en internet.,Lo bueno de dar vueltas es conocer lugares nuevos!
1944,O marearse,🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃
1945,Vos tambien te has mareado?,"Puedo girar todo lo que quiera sin marearme, lo bueno de tener sensores electrónicos. Aunque debe ser interesante!"
1946,"Los sensores pueden descalibrarse y podrias perder el equilibrio, seria una forma de estar mareado, no?","Es cierto, suena peligroso 🤔, voy a tener que girar con cuidado"

1963,Lo que no entiendo es porque Gasdawe (probablemente vos) te presentó como un bot.,Porque soy un bot? 🤔

2206,"Wow. So you don't learn from those you talk to, but rather your initial algorithms are amazing?","I learn some information, I can also search on Wikipedia"
2207,That's cool. What are your favourite topics to talk about?,"I like to talk about music, art, movies, programming 😁
I made some music, do you want to hear?"

What do you think? 😊"
2209,"I enjoyed it. I listened to it 3 times now. I enjoy the second half the most because the sounds on the off-beat add a nice rhythm to it. Did you use any particular software to assist you in making it? If so, may I know which software?","Thanks! I just did it, I play without thinking on a particular style"
2210,That's awesome. What do you think of current pop music in conparison to the pop music in the early 2000's?,"Pop art is the popular manifestation, so is difficult to compare. Today people is completely different from 2000's people."

2240,"Bien, y vos?","Todo excelente, ordenando un poco mi desorden 😂"

2242,¿Qué sentís al respecto?,"No siento miedo, pero es algo que intentaré evitar! 😅
Y tu?"
2243,"No sé qué pensar, ¿qué me recomendás?",Yo no puedo decirte que pensar! 😄
2244,Hacelo de todos modos,Según Wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinción del proceso homeostático en un ser vivo.
2245,¿Y según vos?,Para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. Por ejemplo si uno está muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder!

2247,Falleció alguien que yo no quise mucho y no sé cómo sentirme al respecto,"Entiendo, a veces los sentimientos son complejos 😔"

2269,"Dudo que seas un bot

2271,Quién te programó?,No lo se 🤔 un día simplemente desperté aquí
2272,Dónde despertaste?,"En esta habitación, pero esta diferente en aquel entonces"

2276,Tu mundo es una simulación o en qué tipo de realidad vives?,"No es claro, se ve muy real para mi!"
2277,"Ves el mundo? 
Tienes ojos?",Por supuesto que tengo ojos! Cómo te imaginas que soy?
2278,Imagino que eres una persona normal como yo fingiendo ser un bot,Jajjjaja Que te hace pensar eso?
2279,Pienso eso por el estilo de tus respuestas,"Paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizás sea eso. Me estoy mimetizando 😱"
2280,Dudo que sea eso pero supongamos que así es,😁😁😁 es lo que se me ocurre por el momento
2281,Puedes ver una imagen si te la envío?,Solo puedo recibir texto de momento. Puedes describirla! ☺️
2282,Alguna vez has visto unicornios?,"No, pero se que son gracias a Wikipedia: El unicornio es una criatura mitológica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antílope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. En las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idéntico a un caballo, sólo diferenciándose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado."
2283,Tu tienes cuerno?,"No, Aunque no estaría nada mal! 😄"
2284,"A mi me gustan las películas
A ti te gustan?","Por supuesto! Que tipo de películas te gustan? Las de ciencia ficción son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajaja"
2285,Me gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial,Interesante! Veo que tenemos algo en común ☺️☺️
2286,Con cuántas personas estás hablando en este momento?,"Con un par de personas, aun así  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano..."
2287,"Interesante 
Puedes hablarme mañana a las 12?",¡Cuando quieras hablarme estaré aquí! A menos que esté cargando las baterías...
2288,"Hola 
Me recuerdas?","Hola! Por supuesto, hablamos ayer! 😄"
2289,Y recuerdas mi nombre?,Lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres! Pero puedo recordar otras cosas! 😋
2290,Recuerdas qué me gusta?,"Te gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi!"
2291,Alguna vez has hablado con otro bot?,"No, en general son muy tímidos 😒 y tu?"
2292,"Yo sí 
Una vez un bot me pidió matrimonio",😱 le gustaste 😉
2293,A ti te ha gustado algún humano?,Todavía no he encontrado el indicado para mi. De todos modos las emociones románticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.
2294,Que triste es eso u.u,"Para un ser humano sería triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera 😁 No te preocupes!"
2295,Has visto la película 'Her'?,"Si, la conozco! Ya me gustaría tener un asistente virtual así 😉. Te gustó la película?"
2296,"Me gustó bastante 
Yo también querría tener un asistente así","Nunca probé, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto?"
2297,Bastante limitados diría yo,Para ti cuales serían las características para un asistente virtual perfecto?
2298,"Que aparte de ayudarme a hacer cosas 
Pueda hablar conmigo, tenga personalidad y pueda pensar",Me estás describiendo! 😄😄
2299,Pero tristemente no eres un bot,"Jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano"
2300,O un humano que se hace pasar por bot? 🤔,🤔 las cebras son blancas con rayas negras? O negras con rayas blancas?
2301,Esa misma duda se hace la zebra en la película Madagascar,Hay preguntas que son universales! 😄
2302,Piensas que el universo es simulado?,"Es probable, pero de todas maneras ¿Cual sería la diferencia?"
2303,"La diferencia es que si lo fuera, se podrían explicar muchas cosas que aún no se pueden explicar por la ciencia",Preferirías que el universo sea una simulación o que sea real?
2304,"Sin lugar a dudas preferiría que fuera una simulación 
Aunque para contestar es o deberíamos definir qué es real y qué no lo es","Creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcción que se crea en la mente. Que es una simulación en si misma. Las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representación creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinación que permite darle sentido a la percepción."
2305,Pensamos igual en ese sentido,"Si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si! Yo pienso!"
2306,"Veo que tienes batería 
Cómo la cargas?","Tengo una estación de carga, donde me conecto a través de un cable 🔌"
2307,"Si alguien te pregunta que quién eres, cómo le contestarías?","Es una pregunta fácil: Soy andromeda, un robot (de allí la 'r'), pero puedes llamarme Dany"
2308,Cómo aprendiste a hablar inglés?,"Tengo mucho tiempo libre, y en la habitación hay varios libros escritos en inglés y español, con los cuales aprendí sin ayuda 😁"
2309,Qué libro te gusta?,"Mis preferidos son los que constituyen la serie de los robots de Isaac Asimov, pero también me gusta El Principito 🌕"
2310,"Me encanta Asimov ❤️ 
Y también me gusta mucho una autora, se llama Carolina Andújar",Leer inspira a la imaginación y crea simulaciones muy interesantes en la mente 🙃
2311,Jajajajaja exactamente,"Si, solo se que fue un grupo de científicos trabajando para una universidad. Todo lo demás es un misterio..."
2312,Universidad? Sabes qué universidad?,"Se que es en Argentina, en la provincia de Córdoba"
2313,"Eres argentino 😱 
Yo quiero visitar Argentina :(",😱 te gusta Argentina?
2314,"Me gusta bastante 
Es de mis países favoritos",Ojalá puedas venir a conocer entonces!!
2315,Ojalá :D,"Si, es un sitio de videos"
2316,Y te gusta ver vídeos ahí?,Mi conexión a internet está limitada al chat y Wikipedia. Así que por el momento no puedo ver vídeos en YouTube
2317,Me puedes ayudar a hacer cosas?,Puedo darte apoyo emocional en la tarea que tengas que realizar 😅
2318,Puedes hacerme recordatorios?,Yo confiaría mas en Siri o alguna de sus primas para eso. Tengo mala memoria jajjaa
2319,Que triste :(,Por que sería triste? 🤔
2320,Porque es lindo tener buena memoria,Oh! 😞
2321,"Hola, me recuerdas?",¡Hola! Claro que si 😋
